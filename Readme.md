Welcome to my [`::` sandbox](https://github.com/3F/sandbox) ⛱

This repository may contain everything related to my experiments and similar, such as my experimental or incomplete components and libraries or tests for different languages, frameworks, components, platforms, etc.

*Well, this just continues my old repository from bitbucket (migrated to github at the end of 2016).*

## 🏝 Growing up

Some of these things even can grow into separate projects like it was already, for example,

* [Fastest C++ regex-like wildcards](https://github.com/3F/regXwild);
* [Statistics for each attachment on GitHub.com](https://github.com/3F/GhrMeter.user.js);
* [Algorithm of the high-speed multiplication of LARGE numbers](https://github.com/3F/LX4Cnh);
* [FNV-1a. High-speed 「 128-bit 」 implementation](https://github.com/3F/Fnv1a128);


time will tell...

## 🔎 React

Some of these things can be discussed using 🗞 twitter [@github3F](https://twitter.com/github3F) or here via issues; PRs makes me more happy too.
