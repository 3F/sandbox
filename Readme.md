`::` sandbox 'as is' 

It should contain my experimental or incomplete components and libraries on different languages (in most cases it will be Java, PHP, C++, C#, JavaScript and their different frameworks)

Part of this (like a C++ wildcards) can be separated into new projects.

But I remembered about this old repository only recently, when is started the migration from bitbucket of some my public and private repositories...

But still I need some flexible and convenient thing between pastebin/gist and github way, for something like that.

So I don't know exactly the elegant structure for all this, time will tell... thus, simply to do something as a draft.
