*MulLowNoCorrShifts* (MLnoCS) is the most trivial algorithm of the high-speed multiplications of 128 × 16 numbers.

This was designed for 128×16 due to UTF-16 (theoretically up to 128×32). Part of https://twitter.com/github3F/status/1403748080760111106

For high-speed multiplications of **128 × 128** numbers see **LodgeX4CorrNoHigh** algorithm.
